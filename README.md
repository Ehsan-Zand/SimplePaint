# SimplePaint
This is a Simple Paint java app, with swing and MySQL.
It has the implementation of OOP concept in a good way as an exercise.
It supports the undo and redo of all the paintings.
All the paintings are objects and I serialized and deserialized painting collection and store them in the DB to support redo an undo functions.
